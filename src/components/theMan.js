          <h1>The Man</h1>
          <div>Ace Ventura is an eccentric self-styled 'pet detective' who forsook 
            regular police work to concentrate on this latter pursuit. Like other fictional detectives, 
            he is notable for extraordinary powers of observation and deduction; and on at least one occasion, 
            he has managed to escape being shot by catching a bullet in his teeth.
Ventura's eccentricities include his persistent vulgarity and exceedingly flamboyant behaviour; 
but he is nevertheless a dedicated detective, driven by an insatiable adoration of animals and a 
desire to protect them from human mistreatment. In Ace Ventura, Jr.: Pet Detective, it is implied 
that his abilities, personality, and appearance are hereditary. Although Ace is an animal lover, the 
second film reveals a deep-seated fear of bats.
In most appearances, Ace usually wears an unbuttoned Aloha shirt over a plain white A-shirt, 
with red and black striped trousers and black biker boots. He lives in an apartment alongside many different animals, 
all of whom hide from his landlord, Mr. Schickadance (Mark Margolis), in his absence and whom he owes money for rent.</div>
